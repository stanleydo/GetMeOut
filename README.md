The Get Me Out app is a new Android messaging app that is geared towards safely messaging for help via a discrete SOS button. The application will send out a discrete SMS message when the user is faced with a troubling social interaction with another individual. The SMS message will create an opening for the user to leave the situation.

This application was developed as part of a Software Engineering project at CSULA.
Members include: Christopher Ortega, Andrew Vasquez, and Saul Rugama.
